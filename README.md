Eric's LeetCode Solutions :)
How to Compile and Run the Solutions:

C++:
Requirements: C++ compiler and VSCode extension
To Compile file: g++ -std=c++17 "[file name].cpp" -o run
To Run the program: ./run

Java:
Requirements: JDK and VSCode extension
To Compile file: javac "[file name]".java
To Run the program: java "[file name]"

I've also included tester programs (AI-generated) for that allow users to pass input directly through the terminal for easier debugging and interactive testing.

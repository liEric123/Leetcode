# Eric's LeetCode Solutions :)

## How to Compile and Run the Solutions:

- C++:

Requirements: C++ compiler and VSCode extension

To Compile file: g++ -std=c++17 "[file name].cpp" -o run

To Run the program: ./run

- Java:
Requirements: JDK and VSCode extension

To Compile file: javac "[file name]".java

To Run the program: java [class name]  
Note: In recent Java versions, you can also compile and run in one step: java "[file name]".java
#### I've also included tester programs (AI-generated) for that allow users to pass input directly through the terminal for easier debugging and interactive testing.

#### To help others and myself visualize the algorithms, I created visualizations (AI-assisted) for many problems that help deepen our understanding of solutions.
